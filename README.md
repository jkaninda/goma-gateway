## Features

Goma Gateway is designed for simplicity, flexibility, and robust performance. It supports a wide range of modern features, empowering you to manage and secure traffic efficiently across services.


### Core Features

* **RESTful API Gateway Management**
  Intuitively manage APIs with a clean, declarative configuration system.

* **Domain & Host-Based Routing**
  Route requests by domain or host to different services or environments.

* **Multi-Domain Support**
  Handle traffic across multiple domains with unified configuration.

* **Reverse Proxy Support**
  Forward incoming client requests to backend services seamlessly.

* **WebSocket Proxying**
  Enable real-time applications with full WebSocket support.

---

### Security & Access Control

* **TLS with Automatic Certificate Management**
  Secure your services with built-in TLS support, including:

  * **Free, Auto-Generated Certificates** via Let's Encrypt.
  * **Automatic Renewal & Storage** to ensure uninterrupted HTTPS.
  * **Custom TLS Certificates Support**
  
  Bring your own TLS certificates when needed:
  * Fallback to auto-generation when no custom cert is provided.

* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
  Define and enforce CORS policies per route for controlled cross-origin access.

* **Custom Header Injection**
  Add or override HTTP headers for fine-grained request/response control.

* **Authentication Middleware**

  * **ForwardAuth** support for external authorization services.
  * Built-in support for **Basic Auth**, **JWT**, and **OAuth**.

* **Access Policy Enforcement**
  Allow or deny traffic based on route-specific rules (IP, headers, methods, etc.).

* **Exploit Protection Middleware**
  Block common attack patterns like:

  * SQL injection attempts.
  * Cross-site scripting (XSS).

* **Regex URL Rewriting**
  Modify request paths on the fly using powerful regex rules.

* **Bot Detection**
  Identify and block traffic from known bots using user-agent analysis.

* **HTTP Method Restrictions**
  Explicitly restrict which HTTP methods are allowed per route.

### Monitoring & Observability

* **Comprehensive Logging**
  Capture full request/response details with support for log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

* **Metrics Collection**
  Track key metrics like response times, error rates, and throughput.
  Integrates with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and other observability platforms.

### Rate Limiting & Throttling

* **In-Memory Rate Limiting**
  IP-based throttling suitable for single-instance deployments.

* **Distributed Rate Limiting with Redis**
  Scalable enforcement of request limits across multiple gateway instances.

* **Customizable Policies**
  Configure thresholds (e.g., X requests per Y seconds) to protect APIs.


###  Load Balancing

* **Round-Robin & Weighted Algorithms**
  Distribute traffic evenly or based on weight preferences across backend targets.

* **Integrated Health Checks**
  Automatically route traffic only to healthy upstream services.

* **Horizontal Scalability**
  Add or remove backends dynamically, without restarting the gateway.



### Performance Optimization

* **HTTP Caching**
  Speed up responses and reduce load with route-based caching strategies.

* **Pluggable Cache Backends**

  * **In-Memory** for low-latency, single-node setups.
  * **Redis** for distributed, multi-node cache sharing.

* **Fine-Grained Control**

  * Respect standard `Cache-Control` headers.
  * Custom headers like `X-Cache-Status` for transparency.
  * Time or event-based cache invalidation strategies.


### Configuration & Extensibility

* **Modular Config Files**
  Split and organize routes and middleware using multiple `.yml` or `.yaml` files for clarity.

* **Live Configuration Reload**
  * Apply configuration changes on the fly — no server restarts required.
  * Dynamically enable or disable routes with zero downtime, allowing for flexible, real-time adjustments.

* **Kubernetes CRD Integration**

  * Manage routes, gateways, and middleware via Kubernetes-native CRDs.
  * GitOps-friendly for declarative and version-controlled configuration.

* **Declarative API Gateway Management**  
  Adopt a declarative approach to API Gateway Management, enabling you to:
  - Define routes and middleware programmatically for consistent, code-driven configuration.
  - Integrate GitOps workflows to version control your gateway configurations, ensuring traceable and automated deployments.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Configuration

Generate a configuration file using the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway config init --output /etc/goma/config.yml
```
If no file is provided, a default configuration is created at /etc/goma/goma.yml.

### 2. Validate Configuration

Check your configuration file for errors:

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway config check --config /etc/goma/config.yml

```

### 3. Start the Server with Custom Config

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway server --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```
### 4. Health Checks

Goma Gateway provides the following health check endpoints:
- Gateway Health:
  - `/readyz`
  - `/healthz`
- Routes Health: `/healthz/routes`

### 5. Simple Deployment with Docker Compose

Here’s an example of deploying Goma Gateway using Docker Compose:

Create a file named `config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2
gateway:
  # Timeout settings (in seconds)
  writeTimeout: 15 
  readTimeout: 15 
  idleTimeout: 30 
  # Route definitions
  routes:
    # First route definition - simple proxy to example.com
    - path: /                # Base path to match
      name: example           # Descriptive name for the route
      disabled: false         # Whether the route is disabled
      rewrite: ''             # Path rewrite rule (empty means no rewrite)
      destination: https://example.com  # Target URL for this route
      disableHostForwarding: true  # Don't forward the original host header
      cors: {}                # CORS settings (empty means default/disabled)
      middlewares:
        - basic-auth          # Apply basic authentication middleware
    # Second route definition
    - name: api             
      path: /                 
      disabled: false       
      hosts:                  # Host-based routing (virtual hosting)
        - app.example.com    # Only match requests for this host
      rewrite: /              
      backends:               # Load balancing backends
        - endpoint: https://api-1.example.com  
          weight: 1           
        - endpoint: https://api-2.example.com  
          weight: 3           
      healthCheck:
        path: /
        interval: 15s
        timeout: 10s 
        healthyStatuses:       
          - 200
          - 404
      middlewares: []         # No middlewares for this route

# Middleware definitions
middlewares:
  - name: basic-auth          # Middleware identifier
    type: basic               # Middleware type (basic auth)
    paths:
      - /*                    # Apply to all paths
