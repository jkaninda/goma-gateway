## Features Overview

**Goma Gateway** is a modern, developer-friendly API Gateway built for simplicity, security, and scale.
More than just a reverse proxy, it streamlines service infrastructure management with **declarative configuration** and **enterprise-grade features**.


## Core Capabilities

### **Routing & Traffic Management**

* Declarative **YAML-based configuration**
* Flexible routing for **domains, hosts, paths, WebSocket, gRPC, TCP/UDP**
* Multi-domain & multi-service support in one config
* Reverse proxy with backend abstraction
* Traffic control: **rate limiting, load balancing, health checks**

### **Security & Access Control**

* Automatic HTTPS via **Let’s Encrypt** or custom TLS
* **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for client certificate authentication
* Built-in authentication: **Basic Auth, JWT, OAuth, LDAP, ForwardAuth**
* CORS policies, header injection, fine-grained access control
* Exploit protection: **SQL injection, XSS**, and bot detection
* Method restrictions and regex-based URL rewriting

### **Performance & Reliability**

* **HTTP caching** (in-memory or Redis) with smart invalidation
* Load balancing: round-robin, weighted, with health checks
* Scalable rate limiting: local or Redis-based
  *(with automatic banning for repeated abuse)*

### **Operations & Monitoring**

* Zero-downtime config reloads
* Structured logging with configurable levels
* Prometheus/Grafana metrics
* Graceful error handling and backend failure interception

### **Cloud-Native Integration**

* Kubernetes CRD support for native resource management

## Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following utilities are installed on your system:

* **Docker** — to run the Goma Gateway container
* **Kubernetes** (optional) — if you plan to deploy on Kubernetes

### Installation Steps

### Step 1: Generate the Default Configuration File

Use the following command to generate a default configuration file (`config.yml`):

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway config init --output /etc/goma/config.yml
```

This creates the configuration file under your local `./config` directory.

### Step 2: Customize the Configuration

Open and edit `./config/config.yml` to define your routes, middlewares, backends, and other settings as needed.

### Step 3: Validate Your Configuration

Before running the server, validate your configuration file for any errors:

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway config check --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```

Fix any reported issues before proceeding.

### Step 4: Start the Goma Gateway Server

Run the server container, mounting your configuration, and Let's Encrypt directories, and exposing the default ports:

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  -v "${PWD}/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```

By default, the gateway listens on:

* `8080` for HTTP traffic (`web` entry point)
* `8443` for HTTPS traffic (`webSecure` entry point)

---

### Optional: Use Standard Ports (`80` & `443`)

To run the gateway on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80 and 443), update your configuration as follows:

```yaml
version: 2
gateway:
  timeouts:
    write: 30
    read: 30
    idle: 30
  entryPoints:
    web:
      address: ":80"
    webSecure:
      address: ":443"
  extraConfig:
    # Additional gateway-specific configs here
```

Then start the container with the appropriate port bindings:

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  -v "${PWD}/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```
### 5. Health Checks

Goma Gateway provides the following health check endpoints:
- Gateway Health:
  - `/readyz`
  - `/healthz`
- Routes Health: `/healthz/routes`

### 6. Simple Deployment with Docker Compose

Here’s a simple example of deploying Goma Gateway using Docker Compose:

Create a file named `config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2
gateway:
  # Timeout settings (in seconds)
  timeouts:
    write: 30
    read: 30
    idle: 30
  # Optional, default port 8080
  entryPoints:
    web:
      address: ":80"
    webSecure:
      address: ":443"
  log:
    level: info
  extraConfig:
    directory: /etc/goma/extra
    watch: true
  # Route definitions
  routes:
    #  Route definition 1
    - name: api-example           # Descriptive name for the route  
      path: /api             # Base path to match
      rewrite: / # Rewrite /api to /
      target: http://api-example:8080  # Target URL for this route
      middlewares: ["rate-limit","basic-auth"]
    #  Route definition 2
    - name: host-example
      path: /
      enabled: true         # Whether the route is enabled
      hosts:                  # Host-based routing (virtual hosting)
        - api.example.com    # Only match requests for this host
      backends:               # Load balancing backends
        - endpoint: https://api-1.example.com
          weight: 1

### 7. Grafana Dashboard

Goma Gateway offers built-in monitoring capabilities to help you track the **health**, **performance**, and **behavior** of your gateway and its routes. Metrics are exposed in a **Prometheus-compatible** format and can be visualized using tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

A prebuilt **Grafana dashboard** is available to visualize metrics from Goma Gateway.

You can import it using dashboard ID: [23799](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/23799)
