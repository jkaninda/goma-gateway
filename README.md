## Usage

### 1. Initialize configuration

```shell
docker run --rm  --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/config" \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway config init --output /config/goma.yml
```
### 2. Run server

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/config" \
 -p 80:80 \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway server
```

### 3. Start server with a custom config
```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/config" \
 -p 80:80 \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway server --config /config/config.yml
```
### 4. Healthcheck

- Goma Gateway readiness: `/readyz`
- Routes health check: `/healthz`

Create a config file in this format
## Customize configuration file

Example of a configuration file
```yaml
## Goma - simple lightweight API Gateway and Reverse Proxy.
# Goma Gateway configurations
gateway:
  ########## Global settings
  listenAddr: 0.0.0.0:80
  # Proxy write timeout
  writeTimeout: 15
  # Proxy read timeout
  readTimeout: 15
  # Proxy idle timeout
  idleTimeout: 60
  # Proxy rate limit, it's In-Memory IP based
  # Distributed Rate Limiting for Token based across multiple instances is not yet integrated
  rateLimiter: 0
  accessLog:    "/dev/Stdout"
  errorLog:     "/dev/stderr"
  ## Returns backend route healthcheck errors
  disableRouteHealthCheckError: false
  # Disable display routes on start
  disableDisplayRouteOnStart: false
  # disableKeepAlive allows enabling and disabling KeepALive server
  disableKeepAlive: false
  # interceptErrors intercepts backend errors based on defined the status codes
  interceptErrors:
    - 405
    - 500
  # - 400
  # Proxy Global HTTP Cors
  cors:
    # Global routes cors for all routes
    origins:
      - http://localhost:8080
      - https://example.com
    # Global routes cors headers for all routes
    headers:
      Access-Control-Allow-Headers: 'Origin, Authorization, Accept, Content-Type, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, X-Client-Id, X-Session-Id'
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: 'true'
      Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000
  ##### Define routes
  routes:
    # Example of a route | 1
    - name: Public
      # host Domain/host based request routing
      host: "" # Host is optional
      path: /public
      ## Rewrite a request path
      # e.g rewrite: /store to /
      rewrite: /healthz
      destination:  https://example.com
      #DisableHeaderXForward Disable X-forwarded header.
      # [X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-For, Host, Scheme ]
      # It will not match the backend route, by default, it's disabled
      disableHeaderXForward: false
      # Internal health check
      healthCheck: '' #/internal/health/ready
      # Route Cors, global cors will be overridden by route
      cors:
        # Route Origins Cors, global cors will be overridden by route
        origins:
          - https://dev.example.com
          - http://localhost:3000
          - https://example.com
        # Route Cors headers, route will override global cors
        headers:
          Access-Control-Allow-Methods: 'GET'
          Access-Control-Allow-Headers: 'Origin, Authorization, Accept, Content-Type, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, X-Client-Id, X-Session-Id'
          Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: 'true'
          Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000
      ##### Define route middlewares from middlewares names
      ## The name must be unique
      ## List of middleware name
      middlewares:
        - api-forbidden-paths
        - basic-auth
    # Example of a route | 2
    - name: Authentication service
      path: /auth
      rewrite: /
      destination: 'http://security-service:8080'
      healthCheck: /internal/health/ready
      cors: {}
      middlewares:
        - api-forbidden-paths
    # Example of a route | 3
    - name: Basic auth
      path: /protected
      rewrite: /
      destination: 'http://notification-service:8080'
      healthCheck:
      cors: {}
      middlewares: []

  #Enables JWT authorization based on the result of a request and continues the request.

      requiredHeaders:
        - Authorization
      #Sets the request variable to the given value after the authorization request completes.
      #
      # Add header to the next request from AuthRequest header, depending on your requirements
      # Key is AuthRequest's response header Key, and value is Request's header Key
      # In case you want to get headers from the Authentication service and inject them into the next request's headers
      #Sets the request variable to the given value after the authorization request completes.

      # In case you want to get headers from the Authentication service and inject them to the next request's params
    params:

  # The server will return 404
