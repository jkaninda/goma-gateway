  * **Free, Auto-Generated Certificates** via Let's Encrypt.
  * **Automatic Renewal & Storage** to ensure uninterrupted HTTPS.
  * **Custom TLS Certificates Support**
  
  Bring your own TLS certificates when needed:
  * Fallback to auto-generation when no custom cert is provided.

* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
  Define and enforce CORS policies per route for controlled cross-origin access.

* **Custom Header Injection**
  Add or override HTTP headers for fine-grained request/response control.

* **Authentication Middleware**

  * **ForwardAuth** support for external authorization services.
  * Built-in support for **Basic Auth**, **JWT**,**LDAP**, and **OAuth**.

* **Access Policy Enforcement**
  Allow or deny traffic based on route-specific rules (IP, headers, methods, etc.).

* **Exploit Protection Middleware**
  Block common attack patterns like:

  * SQL injection attempts.
  * Cross-site scripting (XSS).

* **Regex URL Rewriting**
  Modify request paths on the fly using powerful regex rules.

* **Bot Detection**
  Identify and block traffic from known bots using user-agent analysis.

* **HTTP Method Restrictions**
  Explicitly restrict which HTTP methods are allowed per route.

### Monitoring & Observability

* **Comprehensive Logging**
  Capture full request/response details with support for log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

* **Metrics Collection**
  Track key metrics like response times, error rates, and throughput.
  Integrates with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and other observability platforms.

### Rate Limiting & Throttling

* **In-Memory Rate Limiting**
  IP-based throttling suitable for single-instance deployments.

* **Distributed Rate Limiting with Redis**
  Scalable enforcement of request limits across multiple gateway instances.

* **Customizable Policies**
  Configure thresholds (e.g., X requests per Y seconds) to protect APIs.


###  Load Balancing

* **Round-Robin & Weighted Algorithms**
  Distribute traffic evenly or based on weight preferences across backend targets.

* **Integrated Health Checks**
  Automatically route traffic only to healthy upstream services.

* **Horizontal Scalability**
  Add or remove backends dynamically, without restarting the gateway.



### Performance Optimization

* **HTTP Caching**
  Speed up responses and reduce load with route-based caching strategies.

* **Pluggable Cache Backends**

  * **In-Memory** for low-latency, single-node setups.
  * **Redis** for distributed, multi-node cache sharing.

* **Fine-Grained Control**

  * Respect standard `Cache-Control` headers.
  * Custom headers like `X-Cache-Status` for transparency.
  * Time or event-based cache invalidation strategies.


### Configuration & Extensibility

* **Modular Config Files**
  Split and organize routes and middleware using multiple `.yml` or `.yaml` files for clarity.

* **Live Configuration Reload**
  * Apply configuration changes on the fly ‚Äî no server restarts required.
  * Dynamically enable or disable routes with zero downtime, allowing for flexible, real-time adjustments.

* **Kubernetes CRD Integration**

  * Manage routes, gateways, and middleware via Kubernetes-native CRDs.
  * GitOps-friendly for declarative and version-controlled configuration.

* **Declarative API Gateway Management**  
  Adopt a declarative approach to API Gateway Management, enabling you to:
  - Define routes and middleware programmatically for consistent, code-driven configuration.
  - Integrate GitOps workflows to version control your gateway configurations, ensuring traceable and automated deployments.

## üí° Why Use Goma Gateway?

**Goma Gateway** is more than just a reverse proxy ‚Äî it's a modern, developer-friendly API Gateway designed to simplify, secure, and scale your service infrastructure. Here's why it stands out:


### ‚úÖ **Simple, Declarative Configuration**

Configure routes, middleware, policies, and TLS in a clear and concise YAML format. Whether you prefer single-file or multi-file setups, Goma makes configuration intuitive and maintainable.

### üîê **First-Class Security Built-In**

Security isn't an afterthought. Goma ships with robust middleware for:

* Automatic HTTPS with **Let's Encrypt** or your own custom TLS certs.
* Built-in **Auth** support: Basic, JWT, OAuth, and ForwardAuth.
* Protection against **common exploits** like SQLi and XSS.
* Fine-grained **access control**, method restrictions, and bot detection.


### üåê **Multi-Domain & Dynamic Routing**

Host and route traffic across multiple domains effortlessly. Whether you're proxying REST APIs, WebSocket services, or static assets ‚Äî Goma routes requests intelligently based on host and path.


### ‚öôÔ∏è **Live Reload & GitOps-Ready**

No restarts needed. Goma supports **live configuration reloads**, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows. Manage your gateway infrastructure declaratively and version everything.

### üìä **Observability from Day One**

Goma offers full visibility into your traffic:

* **Structured Logging** with log level support.
* **Metrics & Dashboards** via Prometheus/Grafana integrations.
* **Built-in Rate Limiting** to throttle abusive traffic with optional Redis support.


### üöÄ **Performance Optimization**

Speed matters. Goma provides:

* **HTTP Caching** (in-memory or Redis) with intelligent invalidation.
* **Advanced Load Balancing** (round-robin, weighted) and health checks to keep your infrastructure resilient.

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes-Friendly**

Integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes using **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**. Manage routes, middleware, and gateways as native Kubernetes objects.



Whether you're building a secure public API, managing internal microservices, or modernizing legacy systems ‚Äî **Goma Gateway** gives you the power and flexibility you need, without the complexity you don‚Äôt.

## Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following utilities are installed on your system:

* **Docker** ‚Äî to run the Goma Gateway container
* **Kubernetes** (optional) ‚Äî if you plan to deploy on Kubernetes

### Installation Steps

### Step 1: Generate the Default Configuration File

Use the following command to generate a default configuration file (`config.yml`):

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway config init --output /etc/goma/config.yml
```

This creates the configuration file under your local `./config` directory.

### Step 2: Customize the Configuration

Open and edit `./config/config.yml` to define your routes, middlewares, backends, and other settings as needed.

### Step 3: Validate Your Configuration

Before running the server, validate your configuration file for any errors:

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway config check --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```

Fix any reported issues before proceeding.

### Step 4: Start the Goma Gateway Server

Run the server container, mounting your configuration and Let's Encrypt directories, and exposing the default ports:

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  -v "${PWD}/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway server --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```

By default, the gateway listens on:

* `8080` for HTTP traffic (`web` entry point)
* `8443` for HTTPS traffic (`webSecure` entry point)

---

### Optional: Use Standard Ports (`80` & `443`)

To run the gateway on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80 and 443), update your configuration as follows:

```yaml
version: 2
gateway:
  timeouts:
    write: 30
    read: 30
    idle: 30
  entryPoints:
    web:
      address: ":80"
    webSecure:
      address: ":443"
  extraConfig:
    # Additional gateway-specific configs here
```

Then start the container with the appropriate port bindings:

```bash
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
  -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
  -v "${PWD}/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  jkaninda/goma-gateway server --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```
### 5. Health Checks

Goma Gateway provides the following health check endpoints:
- Gateway Health:
  - `/readyz`
  - `/healthz`
- Routes Health: `/healthz/routes`

### 6. Simple Deployment with Docker Compose
