## Features

It's designed to be straightforward and efficient, offering a rich set of features, including:

### Core Features
- **RESTful API Gateway Management**  
  Simplify the management of your API Gateway with powerful tools.

- **Domain/Host-Based Request Routing**  
  Route requests based on specific domains or hosts.

- **Multi-Domain Request Routing**  
  Handle requests across multiple domains seamlessly.

- **Reverse Proxy**  
  Efficiently forward client requests to backend servers.

- **WebSocket Proxy**  
  Enable real-time communication via WebSocket support.

### Security and Control
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**  
  Define and manage cross-origin policies for secure interactions.

- **Custom Headers**  
  Add and modify headers to meet specific requirements.

- **Backend Errors Interceptor**  
  Catch and handle backend errors effectively.

- **Block Common Exploits Middleware**
  - Detect patterns indicating SQL injection attempts.
  - Identify basic cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts.

- **Authentication Middleware**
  - Support for **ForwardAuth** with client authorization based on request results.
  - **Basic-Auth** and **OAuth** authentication mechanisms.
- **Access Policy Middleware**
    - Control route access by either `allowing` or `denying` requests based on defined rules.
- **Regex Support for URL Rewriting**
    - Rewrite URL paths using regex patterns.
- **Bot Detection Middleware**
    - Protect your route from bots by blocking requests from known bots.

### Monitoring and Performance
- **Logging**  
  Comprehensive request and response logging.

- **Metrics**  
  Gather insights and monitor performance metrics.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - **In-Memory Rate Limiting**: Client IP-based request throttling.
  - **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Leverage Redis for scalable, client IP-based rate limits.

- **Load Balancing**  
  Use a round-robin algorithm for efficient load distribution.

### Configuration and Flexibility
- **Support for Multiple Route and Middleware Configuration Files**  
  Organize routes across multiple `.yml` or `.yaml` files.

- **Support dynamic configuration reload**  
  - Reload configuration without restarting the server.
  - Enable or disable routes dynamically, with zero downtime.

- **TLS Support**  
  Ensure secure communication with TLS integration.

- **HTTP Method Restrictions**  
  Limit HTTP methods for specific routes to enhance control.

- **Configure using K8s Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)**
    - Kubernetes operator-focused CRDs (gateway, route, and middleware configuration)
    - Define your gateways, routes, and middleware directly in code for seamless configuration.

Declarative API Gateway Management, define your routes and middleware directly in code for seamless configuration.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Configuration

Generate a configuration file using the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway config init --output /etc/goma/config.yml
```
If no file is provided, a default configuration is created at /etc/goma/goma.yml.

### 2. Validate Configuration

Check your configuration file for errors:

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway config check --config /etc/goma/config.yml

```

### 3. Start the Server with Custom Config

```shell
docker run --rm --name goma-gateway \
 -v "${PWD}/config:/etc/goma/" \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 jkaninda/goma-gateway server --config /etc/goma/config.yml
```
### 4. Health Checks

Goma Gateway provides the following health check endpoints:
- Gateway Health:
  - `/readyz`
  - `/healthz`
- Routes Health: `/healthz/routes`

### 5. Simple Deployment with Docker Compose

Here’s an example of deploying Goma Gateway using Docker Compose:

```shell
services:
  goma-gateway:
    image: jkaninda/goma-gateway
    command: server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8443:8443"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/etc/goma/
```
