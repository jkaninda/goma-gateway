### RateLimit middleware

The RateLimit middleware helps manage the number of requests that services receive, ensuring fair usage according to specified limits. 

This middleware applies to the entire route, eliminating the need to specify individual path fields.

Example of a rate limiting middleware

```yaml
middlewares:
  - name: rate-limit
    type: rateLimit
    rule:
      unit: second          # minute or hour
      requestsPerUnit: 60    # Maximum number of requests per unit of time
```
### Parameters:

- `unit`: The time period used for rate limiting. Can be set to either `minute` or `hour`.
- `requestsPerUnit`: The maximum number of requests allowed per time unit
